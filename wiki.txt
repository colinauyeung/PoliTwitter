The '''2020 United States House of Representatives elections''' were held on November 3, 2020 to elect representatives from all 435 [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] across each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s, as well as six [[Delegate (United States Congress)|non-voting delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and the inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]]. Special House elections were also held on various dates throughout 2020.

In the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had won 235 seats. Leading up to the 2020 elections, the Democrats were projected by many polls to expand their majority by up to 15 seats due to nationwide attitudes over the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and due to the unpopularity of then-President [[Donald Trump]]. While Democrats ultimately retained control of the House following the 2020 elections, they lost a total of 13 seats<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/12/21/why-did-house-democrats-underperform-compared-to-joe-biden/|title=Why did House Democrats underperform compared to Joe Biden?|first=William A.|last=Galston|date=December 21, 2020}}</ref> and entered 2021 with a narrow 222–213 House majority, the narrowest since [[2000 United States House of Representatives elections|2000]].<ref name=AP.Clinch/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/04/democrats-house-control-fragile.html|title=Democrats’ Control of the House Is Increasingly Fragile|first=Ed|last=Kilgore|date=April 6, 2021|website=Intelligencer}}</ref> It was the first time since [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|2004]] where the Republicans made net gains in the House during a presidential year. 

Republicans exceeded expectations in the 2020 House elections, winning back a number of seats that they lost in 2018 while successfully defending competitive seats that Democrats had hoped to flip. No Republican incumbent was defeated for reelection, while 13 incumbent Democrats were ousted by Republicans and several successful Democratic candidates won by smaller-than-expected margins. Many have cited Trump's presence on the ballot as having fueled high Republican turnout,<ref name=AP.Clinch>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-politics-elections-house-elections-nancy-pelosi-1797f752392d02702429b13b1b16b553|title=Dems clinch House control, but majority likely to shrink|publisher=Associated Press|last=Fram|first=Alan|date=November 10, 2020|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/05/2020-election-results-democrats-to-lose-house-seats-but-keep-majority.html|title=Democrats are projected to lose House seats but keep their majority|publisher=CNBC|last=Pramuk|first=Jacob|date=November 5, 2020|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/politics/house-race-results-2020/index.html|title=Some House Democrats fall while the party fails to flip some key suburban districts|publisher=CNN|last1=Pathe|first1=Simone|last2=Foran|first2=Clare|last3=Raju|first3=Manu|date=November 5, 2020|access-date=November 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-iowa-elections-d7c101e1432fbe49191f26d41d6c6832|title=How Democrats came up short in bid to expand House majority|publisher=Associated Press|last1=Weissert|first1=Will|last2=Beaumont|first2=Thomas|date=November 23, 2020|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref> while others have emphasized the Republican Party's efforts to promote their female and minority candidates.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Firozi|first=Paulina|date=November 11, 2020|title=House GOP chipped away at Democratic majority.
